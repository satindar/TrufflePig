9 years later...might as well add something to the README!

This is an implementation of Minesweeper written in an early version of iOS (a pig looking for truffles is more pleasant than looking for mines. Hence the different name yet identical game).

Wrote this while working at Monsoon as evidence of my iOS skills. I was writing mainly Ruby and Javascript and wanted to transition to iOS. 

This strategy worked! We got acquired by Capital One and I was moved to an iOS project when the transition was complete.
